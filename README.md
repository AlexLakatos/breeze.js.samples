=================

Breeze JavaScript Client sample applications.

These are end-to-end samples which means that most of them have both client and server code. The server code could be written in .NET, Node, Ruby, etc.

What they all have in common is an HTML/JavaScript front-end, written with Breeze.js

[**Learn more about these samples**](http://www.breezejs.com/samples) at the Breeze website.
